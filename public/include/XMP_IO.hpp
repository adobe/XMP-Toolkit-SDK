/// \brief Abstract base class for client-managed I/O with \c TXMPFiles.
///
/// \c XMP_IO is an abstract base class for client-managed I/O with \c TXMPFiles. This allows a
/// client to use the embedded metadata processing logic of \c TXMPFiles in cases where a string
/// file path cannot be provided, or where it is impractical to allow \c TXMPFiles to separately
/// open the file and do its own I/O. Although described in terms of files, any form of storage may
/// be used as long as the functions operate as defined.
///
/// This is not a general purpose I/O class. It contains only the necessary functions needed by the
/// internals of \c TXMPFiles. It is intended to be used as an adaptor for an existing I/O mechanism
/// that the client wants \c TXMPFiles to use.
///
/// To use \c XMP_IO, a client creates a derived class then uses the form of \c TCMPFiles::OpenFile
/// that takes an \c XMP_IO parameter instead of a string file path. The derived \c XMP_IO object
/// must be ready for use when \c TCMPFiles::OpenFile is called.
///
/// There are no Open or Close functions in \c XMP_IO, they are specific to each implementation. The
/// derived \c XMP_IO object must be open and ready for use before being passed to \c
/// TXMP_Files::OpenFile, and remain open and ready for use until \c TXMP_Files::CloseFile returns,
/// or some other fatal error occurs. The client has final responsibility for closing and
/// terminating the derived \c XMP_IO object.
